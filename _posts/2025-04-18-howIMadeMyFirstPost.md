was i nice day today , i liked how i tryed my best to live a 'cozy' day , for lots cozy it means a warmh and confy room or situation  
i call it leaving life , is when u experience life and realize u are alive , and accept your mortality , and then u chill, even right 
know as i write this post im cillin no , makeing money , no other external influence of social push of urge for making something , 
just me and my work , for my dreams .
BUT carefull im just here doing the stuff and not having a rush to end the task to pass at the next im enjoing every key typed and
every word said , this is leaving , this is working a meaning full life ( to me) when u dont care of finish this task for the next
u do the task , then if it finish good , lets proced to the next , like a black universe with only one stair; u can chose to stay 
where u are , to go left or go right, doesnt really meeter because the time at the top tickels any way , that u run , that u walk
or stay still, the countdown will reach 0. PEACE guys
